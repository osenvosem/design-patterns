The Module pattern was originally defined as a way to provide both private and public encapsulation for classes in conventional software engineering. Modules help in keeping the units of code for a project both cleanly separated and organized.

In JavaScript, there are several options for implementing modules. These include:

- The Module pattern;
- Object literal notation;
- AMD modules;
- CommonJS modules;
- ECMAScript Harmony modules.
